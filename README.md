This project involved building a digital clock application that could display both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats 
while allowing the user to increment hours, minutes, and seconds interactively. The goal was to solve the problem 
of presenting time in a flexible and user-friendly way that aligned with international standards while reinforcing 
object-oriented design principles. I think I did particularly well at organizing the program using classes and methods, 
keeping the logic for time manipulation encapsulated within the Clock class. This separation of concerns made the main 
method cleaner and easier to follow. Additionally, the output formatting with proper spacing ensured that the 
side-by-side clock displays were clear and professional.

One area I could enhance would be adding stronger input validation, such as rejecting invalid hours, minutes, or 
seconds before constructing the clock, which would make the program more robust and secure. The most challenging part 
was aligning the formatting for the side-by-side display, but I overcame it by experimenting with printf formatting 
until the columns matched properly. For support, I relied on documentation for Java’s System.out.printf, which I now 
know I can reuse in future formatting tasks. The transferable skills from this project include working with encapsulation, 
method design, and formatted console output, all of which are widely applicable to larger projects. I made the program 
maintainable and readable by following clear naming conventions, adding descriptive comments for each method, and keeping 
the structure modular so that future enhancements, such as real-time ticking or GUI integration, could be implemented 
without rewriting core logic.
